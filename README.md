# Spacetraders

My Spacetraders API client

## Tasks

Tasks are managed using [Taskfile](https://taskfile.dev/)

### openapi

`task openapi` generates the OpenAPI client, to be used when the game updates.
Note: Some manual works is required after this command due to conflict with some constant names but nothing taking more than 5 minutes.

### start

`task start` run the project
```
